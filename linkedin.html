This was the first real company that I was hired at. I was initially hired as a Social Effects Developer because of my background in game development and writing shader code, but slowly the company focus shifted towards AI and LLMs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
I quickly had to adapt from writing opengl shaders to full stack web applications and navigate developing frontend, backend and middleware development while maintaining coding best practices and mentoring interns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
Until one fine day, tragedy struck and I had to stop working. I had run into some issues with immigration which, thanfully, have been resolved, but the company was moving fast and being unable to work was a hinderance to their goals.

                      My fears were confirmed when I was going through job interview. I realized I was a really green developer. But one day I met a great frontend developer Mikhail and he invited me to join his team as a junior developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I immediately plunged into another world in the first days. It was very difficult for me because I started to work among people who were more experienced than me. Mikhail was demanding, but a fair lead. He helped me but I couldn't prove myself because I felt self-doubt.

A bachelors degree at Pondichery University, right after school. I learned many things, but the most important skills (in my opinion), I picked up here, are effectively communicating ideas, and resolving conflict without confrontations.

This marks a new year in a completely different environment. The first time I'm seeing snow, and a completely different approach to what an education can be. I picked up a lot of technical and soft skills and Georgian College is where I consider my workaholic tendencies began.                     </p>
